They have high dielectric strength and are resistant to many solvents. They also exhibit negligible water absorption. Typical applications include roller bearings, gears, reels, counters, control cams, valves, and pump parts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CPVC <\/strong>&#8211; Chlorinating PVC results in a polymer that has all of PVC&#8217;s good qualities, plus improved fire retardancy, weatherability, a higher maximum working temperature, and light fastness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Halar\u00ae (ECTFE) <\/strong>&#8211; Ethylene-Chlorotrifluorethylene copolymer exhibits better mechanical properties than many other fluoroplastics. But like other fluoroplastics, its flame retardance, chemical resistance, and low dielectric constant remain constant over a wide temperature range. These qualities make it suitable for use in such products as electrical insulation, monofilament, tank linings, housings, and electrical components. It may be usefully employed at temperatures from the cryogenic range to about 330\u00baF.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Isoplast\u2122<\/strong> &#8211; Isoplast urethane resins are high tensile strength, chemically resistant resins originally developed for medical use. They are available in long glass fiber-filled grades. Isoplast combines the toughness and dimensional stability of amorphous resins with the chemical resistance of crystalline materials. The long fiber-reinforced grades are strong enough to replace some metals in load-bearing applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kynar\u00ae (PVDF)<\/strong> &#8211; Polyvinylidene fluorides have a useful temperature range of -148\u00baF to 302\u00baF. It has good strength, creep resistance, and weatherability. Like some other chlorinated engineering plastics, it will not support combustion in the air.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lexan\u00ae (PC)<\/strong> &#8211; Polycarbonate exhibits the highest impact strength over a range of temperatures from -60\u00baF to 270\u00baF. It is fine for all precision parts, or where transparency is desired. Its water-clear transmittance (89%) makes it excellent for visors or guards. It shows good creep resistance and has a temperature-independent dielectric constant, as well as good insulating properties.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Noryl\u00ae (PPE)<\/strong> &#8211; Modified polyphenylene ether is one of the more widely known engineering plastics and has gained UL and FDA approval for a broad spectrum of moldable and foamable grades. It has good impact strength at low temperatures and is resistant to many agents, including steam. It may be furnished in either unreinforced or reinforced grades, and remains stable when processed. The yield strength of reinforced grades is comparable to aluminum. Typical end uses include computer and electric housings, automotive body parts, and piping.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nylon 6\/6<\/strong>&#8211; All grades possess toughness and resiliency and have high fatigue strength. Resistance to oils and hydrocarbon solvents is also good. Almost all formulations are self-extinguishing and retain stable mechanical properties at temperatures from -75\u00baF to above 225\u00baF. They are widely used for latches, cams, gears, and many other moving parts due to their excellent abrasion and impact resistance. Nylon is also available in a variety of cast forms and mobdylidenum disulphide-filled grades (Nylatron\u00ae GS).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nylon 46<\/strong> &#8211; Bridges the price-performance gap between traditional nylons and high-performance materials. Suitable for both extrusion and injection molding, Nylon 46 offers a range of functionality, including extensive UL classifications and specialized wear and bearing grades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PCTFE<\/strong> &#8211; Polychlorotrifluoroethylene is highly transparent. It also exhibits good electrical properties, and is resistant to most common solvents at room temperature. PCTFE is less permeable to gasses and water vapor than any other transparent film.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PEEK\u00ae<\/strong> &#8211; Polyetheretherketone is a new material that has excellent chemical resistance and is rated for continuous service to 470\u00baF. It is tough and strong, with low creep, and has the best fire safety rating of all thermoplastics. It tolerates radiation to 1100 M rads without undergoing significant change. Applications include engine parts, aerospace components, and other uses which require PEEK&#8217;s unique qualities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PES\u00ae<\/strong> &#8211; Crystal clear polyethersulfone has truly outstanding creep resistance, dimensional stability, and excellent mechanical properties. It can withstand continuous use in air and water at temperatures above 350\u00baF. It has low flammability and minimal smoke emission during burning. Its weatherability and solvent resistance are also good. Since PES is sterilizable, it has a wide variety of medical applications. Other applications include electronic components of all types and structural parts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PFA\u00ae<\/strong> &#8211; Perfluoroalkoxy resins, which are marketed under the Teflon\u00ae trademark, have properties similar to FEP and PTFE. However, unlike FEP, PFA may be used at temperatures of approximately 500\u00baF. While PFA shares PTFE&#8217;s chemical resistance and low coefficient of friction, it is also a moldable and extrudable material. Some applications include packing and seals, cable sheathing, and fire-retardant insulation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Phenolic<\/strong> &#8211; Phenolic laminates encompass a wide variety of grades, each with a specific set of properties. Phenolics are manufactured by impregnating layers of material with a phenolic resin, and then applying heat and pressure, which transforms these layers into a solid mass. The result is a thermoset that is dense, dimensionally stable, structurally strong, has low creep, and is an excellent insulator. This general group of industrial laminates also includes glass fabrics laminated with melamine, epoxy, or silicone resins.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Polycarbonate<\/strong> &#8211; This material exhibits the highest impact strength over a range of temperatures from -60\u00baF to 270\u00baF. It is fine for all precision parts or where transparency is desired. Its water-clear transmittance (89%) makes it excellent for visors or guards. It shows good creep resistance and has a temperature-independent dielectric constant, as well as good insulating properties.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Polyethylene (PE) <\/strong>&#8211; Because of its flexibility at low temperatures, excellent electrical resistance, and low dielectric constant, Polyethylene is unique. PE&#8217;s self-lubricating properties also make it ideal for applications such as rollers, skids, and other end-uses, which call for a non-stick, low-friction material. PE is available in a wide range of densities and formulations.<\/p>\n\t<p><strong>Polypropylene (PP)<\/strong> &#8211; has good impact resistance and structural rigidity. It is unaffected by any solvent at room temperature. It has excellent insulating properties and is extremely lightweight. Its high fatigue strength makes it a top choice under cyclic loading conditions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Polystyrene (PS)<\/strong> &#8211; is naturally clear. It exhibits excellent chemical resistance and is more resistant to irradiation than PE or PP. Electrical resistance is also good. This, plus the ease with which PS can be painted or shielded, has led to extensive electrical and electronic applications. PS is also often used in appliances and housings. Special high gloss and high-impact grades are also widely available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Polysulfone (PSO)<\/strong> &#8211; is a naturally transparent, true engineering plastic whose electrical and mechanical properties are constant up to temperatures above 320\u00baF. It is also rated for continuous service in steam to 300\u00baF. It shows excellent resistance to alkalies, acids, and salts, as well as to many hydrocarbons. PSO is suited for microwave use, and may also be plated or glass-filled. Amongst its varied uses are many medical, automotive, and electronic applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PVC<\/strong> &#8211; Polyvinylchloride exhibits little or no water absorption. Since it is chlorinated, PVC also possesses natural flame-retardant qualities. PVCs are available in a wide variety of colors and varying compositions. They are typically employed in packaging, water, and chemical piping assemblies, appliances, furniture, and other components.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RADEL\u00ae A-200<\/strong> &#8211; is a polyethersulfone resin offering high heat deflection temperatures, excellent toughness and dimensional stability, and superior resistance to steam, boiling water, and mineral acids. Other desirable properties include thermal stability, creep resistance, and inherent flame resistance. Grade A-200 is a medium viscosity grade that can be used for either extrusion or injection molding. It is transparent and injection-moldable to close tolerances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RADEL\u00ae AG-330<\/strong> &#8211; is a 30% glass fiber-reinforced polyethersulfone compound. Adding glass fiber to Radel A-300 polyethersulfone substantially increases the rigidity, tensile strength, creep resistance, dimensional stability, and chemical resistance of the material, while maintaining most of its other basic characteristics. The combination of structural properties and cost-effectiveness makes this resin an attractive alternative to metals in many engineering applications. Radel AG330 is an opaque, grayish material in its natural form and may be readily colored.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RADEL\u00ae R-5000, R-5100 NT15, R-5500<\/strong> &#8211; are polyphenylsulfone resins offering exceptional hydrolytic stability and toughness superior to other commercially-available high-temperature engineering resins. They offer high deflection temperatures and outstanding resistance to environmental stress cracking. The polymer is inherently flame retardant, and also has excellent thermal stability and good electrical properties. Radel R-5000 resin is a transparent injection molding grade. R-5100 NT15 is an opaque general-purpose injection molding grade, and R-5500 is a transparent extrusion grade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ryton\u00ae PPS<\/strong> &#8211; This exceptionally strong, thermally stable, corrosion-resistant engineering thermoplastic retains structural integrity under the most demanding conditions of temperature and physical abuse. In continuous-service applications, Ryton\u00ae PPS boasts UL temperature indices up to 240\u00baC with outstanding dimensional stability. It can withstand short-term exposures to temperatures greater than 500\u00baF. It is inherently flame retardant and exhibits low smoke emission and nontoxic gas generation. Ryton\u00ae PPS is resistant to a broad spectrum of solvents, organic acids, and alkalies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Teflon\u00ae (PTFE) <\/strong>&#8211; An extremely low coefficient of friction makes Polytetrafluoroethylene the ideal choice where surface wear might otherwise be a problem. PTFE also exhibits a useful service life from below -100\u00baF to over 500\u00baF. Its resistance to solvents is also excellent throughout a wide range of temperatures. Its low dielectric constant and electrical resistance also remain constant throughout this range.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tefzel\u00ae (ETFE)<\/strong> &#8211; Ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer is a high-impact material with properties similar to ECTFE. It is commonly used to manufacture pumps, valves, computer housings, and other electrical components.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Torlon\u00ae (PAI)<\/strong> &#8211; Polyamide-imide possesses a combination of great mechanical strength, the ability to withstand radiation, usability from approximately -300\u00baF to 500\u00baF, and resistance to most chemicals at room temperature. It is also flame retardant and gives off almost no smoke when burned. It is available in unreinforced and reinforced grades and is readily machinable. This combination of assets makes it a good metal substitute for aerospace and electronic applications. It is commonly used for bushings, seals, and distributors in engines and machinery.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ULTEM<\/strong> &#8211; Unreinforced ULTEM\u00ae (polyetherimide) keeps its hardness, and mechanical properties from -40\u00baF, up to temperatures of 356\u00baF. It is radiation-resistant, microwave transparent, and naturally flame-retardant. Reinforced grades have even higher mechanical strength. Because of its unequaled properties, ULTEM\u00ae is the ideal replacement for steel and other metals. It also has a wide range of electronic and medical applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>UHMW\u00ae<\/strong> &#8211; While Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene retains the inherent qualities of low-density polyethylene, its increased toughness allows its use in a wide variety of rugged applications. It is commonly employed to provide rollers, cams, impellers, and bumper guards.<\/p>\n<p>Because of its high lubricity, it is also used to coat conveyor belts, ramps, and hoppers. UHMW&#8217;s imperviousness to attack by steam and chemicals, and its continued good performance at low temperatures, have also enabled it to gain FDA approval for a variety of applications within the food and drug industries.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guide to Our Plastic Materials Acetal (Delrin\u00ae, Celcon\u00ae) &#8211; Acetals display good impact resistance, dimensional stability, and outstanding surface hardness due to their high degree of crystallinity.
